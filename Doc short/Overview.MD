# Overview

## Tonhub extension
***Tonhub extension*** is a feature that allows you to simply integrate your application into Tonhub app. Connect with our large and rapidly growing user base.

Basically, you should use the following:

* Tonhub Connect for interaction with the user's wallet. 
* Tonhub Link Generator for Tonhub extensions, which creates installation links.

See [Getting started](https://github.com/Reveloper/TwhExt/blob/main/Doc%20short/Getting%20started.md) for more details.

1. The user scans extension's QR-code or clicks on the link from your app.
2. The user approves extension installation in Tonhub.
3. The user follows the steps with sign agreements, donates and so on.
4. The user gets your app in Tonhub's extensions list.
