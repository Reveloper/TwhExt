# Overview

## Tonhub extension
***Tonhub extension*** is a feature that allows you to simply integrate your application into Tonhub app. Connect with our large and rapidly growing user base.

Basically, you should use the following:

* Tonhub Connect for interaction with the user's wallet. 
* Tonhub Link Generator for Tonhub extensions, which creates installation links.

See [Getting started](https://github.com/Reveloper/TwhExt/blob/main/Doc%20short/Getting%20started.md) for more details.
